## [Unreleased]

### Phase 2, Part 4: Public Hackathon Landing Page (April 17, 2026)

#### Added
- Public landing page route: `/hackathons/[slug]` under `(public)` route group with competitive dark theme
- Public layout: applies `.theme-competitive` class to all public-facing pages
- Hero section: cover image with `next/image` (priority) or gradient fallback, title (Space Grotesk), org name, status badge, registration dates, disabled "Register Now" CTA (wired in Phase 3)
- Share buttons: Copy Link (Clipboard API with "Copied!" feedback), X/Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp — icons only on mobile, icons + labels on sm+
- About section: hackathon description with `whitespace-pre-line` and `max-w-3xl`
- Tracks section: single track inline vs multi-track responsive card grid (1→2→3 cols) with external resource links
- Timeline section: horizontal layout (lg+) with connector line, vertical layout (mobile/tablet), phase type icons (UserPlus, Upload, Search, Scale, Trophy), token-driven state colors (active/completed/upcoming)
- Prizes section: sorted by rank, top 3 with gold/silver/bronze accent backgrounds, prize images via signed URLs
- Rules section: renders Tiptap HTML via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with `prose prose-invert` typography styling
- FAQs section: client-side accordion with `grid-rows-[1fr]/grid-rows-[0fr]` CSS animation, parses H2 headings as questions, single-open mode
- Sticky section nav: Intersection Observer scroll spy with `rootMargin: '-20% 0px -70% 0px'`, sentinel pattern for sticky detection, glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-md bg-background/80`) when stuck, horizontal scroll on mobile
- Footer: "Powered by HackForge" branding with homepage link
- Custom 404 page: SearchX icon, ambiguous messaging ("not found or no longer available"), "Back to HackForge" CTA
- SEO: `generateMetadata()` with Open Graph (title, description, cover image) and Twitter card tags
- Status gating: only `published`, `active`, `judging`, `completed` statuses render; `draft` and `archived` return `notFound()`
- 15 new CSS design tokens in `.theme-competitive`: prize accents (gold/silver/bronze), hero gradient fallback, timeline phase states (active/completed/upcoming/connector), section divider — all registered in `@theme inline` block

#### Changed
- `HackathonWithRelations` interface extended with `orgName: string`
- `getHackathonBySlug()` and `getHackathonById()` now fetch and return org name from organizations table

### Phase 2 Cleanup: ESLint + Build Fixes (April 17, 2026)

#### Fixed
- `wizard-shell.tsx`: moved state declarations (`setHackathonData`, `setPhasesData`, `setTracksData`, `setPrizesData`, `setVisitedSteps`) above callbacks that referenced them — fixed `react-hooks/immutability` errors; added `setCurrentStep` to `handleTemplateSelect` dependency array — fixed `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning; replaced `useEffect` + synchronous `setState` with direct initial state for resume dialog — fixed `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`; removed unused `useEffect` import
- `dashboard/page.tsx`: escaped apostrophe in "you'd" — fixed `react/no-unescaped-entities`
- `verify-email/page.tsx`: replaced synchronous `setState` in effect with conditional initial state for no-token case — fixed `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`; extracted content into `VerifyEmailContent` component and wrapped in `<Suspense>` boundary — fixed Next.js build prerender error for `useSearchParams()`
- `invite/accept/page.tsx`: refactored to derive synchronous states (no-token, not-logged-in, unverified) outside the effect, using effect only for async API call — fixed `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` and `react-hooks/immutability`; removed unused `useRouter` import — fixed `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`; escaped apostrophe in "Don't" — fixed `react/no-unescaped-entities`; wrapped `InviteAcceptContent` in `<Suspense>` boundary — fixed Next.js build prerender error
- `login/page.tsx`: wrapped `<LoginForm />` in `<Suspense>` boundary — fixed potential Next.js build prerender error for `useSearchParams()`
- `reset-password/page.tsx`: wrapped `<ResetPasswordForm />` in `<Suspense>` boundary — fixed potential Next.js build prerender error for `useSearchParams()`

### Phase 2, Part 3: Hackathon List + Management (April 17, 2026)

#### Added
- Hackathon list page: filterable, searchable grid of all org hackathons with status badges, template labels, cover image gradients, and creation dates
- Client-side filters: search by title, status pill selector (All/Draft/Published/Active/Judging/Completed/Archived), date range pickers (Created after/before)
- Admin context menu per hackathon: Edit, View Landing Page, Publish, Archive, Delete Draft — all role-gated to `org_admin`
- Delete confirmation dialog (AlertDialog) for draft deletion with soft-delete
- Check-on-access lifecycle engine (`hackathon-lifecycle.ts`): automatically resolves hackathon and phase statuses based on current date whenever a hackathon is loaded (no cron job needed for V1)
- API route: `POST /api/hackathons/[hackathonId]/transition` — manual status transitions (draft→published, completed→archived only)
- API route: `POST /api/hackathons/[hackathonId]/delete` — soft-delete draft hackathons
- `getHackathonStats()` service method returning total/active/draft counts per org
- Org dashboard stat cards now show real hackathon counts (replacing Phase 1 placeholder zeros)
- Loading skeleton for hackathon list page
- Empty states: distinct messaging for "no hackathons yet" vs "no filter matches" with Create CTA

#### Changed
- `getHackathonById()`, `getHackathonBySlug()`, `getHackathonsByOrgId()` now run check-on-access status resolution before returning results
- Manual status transitions restricted to draft→published and completed→archived only; middle-state transitions (published→active, active→judging, judging→completed) are date-driven
- `transitionStatusSchema` (Zod) narrowed to accept only `'published'` and `'archived'` as target statuses
- Org dashboard page now fetches real data via `getHackathonStats()` instead of rendering hardcoded values

### Phase 2, Part 2: Hackathon Creation Wizard + Edit Mode (April 17, 2026)

#### Added

- Step 3: Tracks — add/edit/delete/reorder tracks with drag-and-drop (@hello-pangea/dnd)
- Step 4: Timeline — editable phase dates with per-phase and cross-phase chronological validation
- Step 5: Team rules — min/max team size, individual participation toggle, visibility dropdown
- Step 6: Prizes — add/edit/delete/reorder prizes with presets and image upload
- Step 7: Rules & FAQs — two Tiptap v3 rich text editors (bold, italic, headings, lists, links)
- Step 8: Review & Publish — read-only summary with edit links, client-side validation, publish flow
- Wizard sidebar: three-state data-driven indicators (complete/incomplete/not started), clickable up to highest reached step
- Resume draft flow: detects existing drafts on `/create`, shows dialog to resume or start fresh
- Edit hackathon route (`/hackathons/[hackathonId]/edit`) — pre-fills wizard with existing data
- Image crop modal with locked 16:9 aspect ratio, outputs 1280×720 WebP
- Tiptap editor component with 9-button toolbar and transaction-based active state syncing
- API routes: POST/PATCH/DELETE for hackathons, tracks, phases, prizes; POST publish; POST upload image
